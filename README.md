## Project 1: Factors Affecting Student Grades
- This project is about finding factors affecting Student Grades from our dataset. In our dataset, we only used these factors: health, study time, and absences to predict the grades. Grades are represented in three columns in the dataset: G1, G2, and G3.
- We found that health and absences have a very low and negligible negative correlation with students' grades. Study time has a slight positive correlation with the grades of the student.
- A new column called "Average" was created by averaging out columns G1, G2, and G3, which are students' grades for each quarter.
